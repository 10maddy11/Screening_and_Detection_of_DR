# Screening_and_Detection_of_DR
Screening and early detection of diabetic retinopathy using deep learning 
## To Run
To run this module you need too install following dependencies 
### pip install
```
    pandas
    sklearn
    pickle
    PIL
    tensorflow
    keras
```
This project consist CNN and preprocessing logic which is used for training the module.
we have provided pre-trained module which is having less accuracy 
To download full dataset you can visit

## note 
In the classifier.py file you need to change path to model.hd5 means you need to put your systems path and to test new image provide any fundus images from test_case folder and kept it in test_images/uploaded. (Put one image at a time.) 
then simply run classifier.py.
